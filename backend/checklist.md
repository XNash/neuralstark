# NeuralStark Project Checklist

This checklist outlines the key features and development steps for the NeuralStark FastAPI project.

## Core Features:

- [x] FastAPI Setup
- [x] AI Chat Endpoint
- [x] AI Tool Usage Integration (with canvas consideration)
- [x] Document Watchdog Service
- [x] Automatic Knowledge Integration from Documents
- [x] Intelligent Indexing and Response Mechanism
- [x] Redis Integration
- [x] OpenAPI (Swagger UI) for API Testing
- [x] Robust Document Management

## Development Phases:

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic API
- [x] Create project directory `neuralstark/`
- [x] Initialize `main.py` (FastAPI app)
- [x] Initialize `config.py`
- [x] Initialize `requirements.txt`
- [x] Verify OpenAPI (Swagger UI) is accessible
- [x] Create a basic "Hello World" endpoint (Done in main.py)
- [x] Create `knowledge_base/` directory for watched files

### Phase 2: Document Processing & Watchdog
- [x] Implement `watchdog` to monitor `knowledge_base/`
- [x] Develop document parsing utilities (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- [x] Set up a background task queue (e.g., using Celery with Redis broker) for document processing
- [x] Define document metadata structure

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base & AI Integration
- [x] Design knowledge representation (embeddings)
- [x] Integrate a vector store (e.x., ChromaDB, FAISS)
- [x] Implement document indexing logic using LangChain
- [x] Integrate `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` via LangChain for AI chat
- [x] Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for intelligent responses
- [x] Define and implement AI tools using LangChain's tool capabilities

### Phase 4: Redis & Optimization
- [x] Integrate Redis for caching, session management, and task queue
- [x] Optimize indexing and retrieval for large datasets
- [x] Implement performance monitoring (Basic logging of execution times)

### Phase 5: API Refinement & Testing
- [x] Develop comprehensive API endpoints for chat, tool management, document management
- [x] Add input validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement authentication/authorization
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [x] Finalize OpenAPI documentation

### Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring (Future)
- [ ] Containerization (Docker)
- [ ] Deployment strategy
- [ ] Logging and monitoring

## Best Practices & Quality:
- [x] Adhere to FastAPI best practices
- [x] Ensure code readability and maintainability
- [x] Implement robust error handling
- [x] Consider scalability from the outset
- [ ] Security considerations (input sanitization, etc.)
- [x] Leverage LangChain's modularity for AI components
