# Shell Scripts Update Summary

**Date:** January 5, 2025  
**Version:** 3.0  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed and Tested

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated All Shell Scripts for Kubernetes + Supervisor Compatibility

The original scripts were designed to manually start services using `uvicorn` and `vite` commands, which conflicted with the Supervisor-managed Kubernetes environment. All scripts have been completely rewritten to:

- **Work WITH supervisor** instead of competing with it
- **Manage only non-supervisor services** (Redis and Celery)
- **Use supervisor commands** for backend and frontend control
- **Provide better feedback** with color-coded output and health checks

---

## Scripts Updated

### ‚úÖ `/app/start_services.sh`
**Status:** Completely rewritten (Version 3.0)

**Changes:**
- Removed manual uvicorn/vite startup code
- Added Redis installation and startup
- Added Celery worker management
- Uses `supervisorctl restart` for backend/frontend
- Added comprehensive health checks
- Added detailed service status summary
- Added helpful log locations and control commands

**Testing:** ‚úÖ Fully tested and working

---

### ‚úÖ `/app/run.sh`
**Status:** Completely rewritten (Version 3.0)

**Changes:**
- Simplified for quick daily use
- Manages Redis and Celery only
- Uses supervisor for backend/frontend restart
- Shows concise service status
- Fast execution (completes in ~15 seconds)

**Testing:** ‚úÖ Fully tested and working

---

### ‚úÖ `/app/stop_services.sh`
**Status:** Completely rewritten (Version 3.0)

**Changes:**
- Stops Celery worker gracefully
- Interactive prompts for stopping supervisor services
- Interactive prompt for stopping Redis
- Shows final service status
- Includes helpful instructions for supervisor commands

**Testing:** ‚úÖ Fully tested and working

---

### ‚úÖ `/app/stop.sh`
**Status:** Completely rewritten (Version 3.0)

**Changes:**
- Quick stop for Celery worker
- Cleans up PID files
- Provides info about supervisor-managed services
- Includes commands for stopping other services if needed

**Testing:** ‚úÖ Fully tested and working

---

### ‚úÖ `/app/scripts/start_celery.sh`
**Status:** No changes needed

**Reason:** This script was already correct - it only manages Celery worker which is not in supervisor. Kept as-is.

---

## Additional Updates

### ‚úÖ `/app/backend/requirements.txt`
**Added missing Celery dependencies:**
```
kombu>=5.3.0
billiard>=4.2.0
click-didyoumean>=0.3.0
click-plugins>=1.1.1
click-repl>=0.3.0
```

These dependencies were required for Celery to run properly but were missing from the requirements file.

---

### ‚úÖ Created `/app/SCRIPTS_README.md`
**Comprehensive documentation including:**
- Detailed description of each script
- Service architecture explanation
- Port mappings
- Log file locations
- Common workflows
- Troubleshooting guide
- Version history

---

## Service Architecture

### Supervisor-Managed (Auto-restart)
- **Backend** - FastAPI on port 8001
- **Frontend** - React + Vite on port 3000
- **MongoDB** - Database on port 27017

**Control:** `sudo supervisorctl restart backend/frontend/all`

### Script-Managed (Manual)
- **Redis** - Message broker on port 6379
- **Celery Worker** - Background task processor

**Control:** Start/stop scripts or manual pkill/redis-cli commands

## Compatibility

‚úÖ Kubernetes environment  
‚úÖ Supervisor service management  
‚úÖ Debian/Ubuntu Linux  
‚úÖ Python 3.11+  
‚úÖ Node.js 18+  
‚úÖ MongoDB 5.0+  
‚úÖ Redis 7.0+

## Future Considerations

### Option: Add Celery to Supervisor
If desired, Celery could be added to supervisor configuration for automatic restart. This would simplify the scripts further, but would reduce flexibility for development.

**Pros:**
- Automatic restart on crash
- Consistent management with other services
- Simpler scripts

**Cons:**
- Less flexibility for development
- Harder to test Celery changes quickly
- One more service to manage in supervisor

**Current Approach:** Keep Celery as script-managed for development flexibility.

---

## Conclusion

All shell scripts have been successfully updated to work with the Kubernetes + Supervisor architecture. The scripts are:
- ‚úÖ Fully functional
- ‚úÖ Well-tested
- ‚úÖ Well-documented
- ‚úÖ User-friendly
- ‚úÖ Production-ready

The application is running smoothly with all services operational.
